Here is a step-by-step procedure for your data engineering project using SSIS, SSAS, SSRS, SQL, and Power BI:
Data Extraction and Staging
Use SSIS to create an ETL pipeline that extracts data from the MySQL source database
Transform and cleanse the extracted data as needed using SSIS
Load the transformed data into a SQL Server staging database
Create views in the staging area to minimize joins and optimize performance
Use SSIS again to extract data from the staging area
Implement merge operations using stored procedures to load data into the centralized data warehouse
Data Warehouse and Dimensional Modeling
Design a dimensional model for the data warehouse based on business requirements
Implement the dimensional model in the data warehouse database
Ensure data quality and enforce data integrity constraints
Data Analysis and Reporting
Use SSAS to create a cube based on the dimensional model in the data warehouse
Allow business users to slice and dice data using the SSAS cube
Develop tabular reports using SSRS based on the data in the data warehouse
Create interactive reports and dashboards using Power BI
Build a sales analysis report in Power BI to provide insights to stakeholders
Here is a high-level architecture diagram for the project:

A[MySQL Source] --> B[SSIS ETL]

E --> H[Power BI Reports]

The key components are:
MySQL Source: The original data source
SSIS ETL: Extracts, transforms, and loads data from MySQL to staging and data warehouse
SQL Server Staging: Intermediate database for data cleansing and optimization
Data Warehouse: Central repository with dimensional model
SSAS Cube: Analytical model for slicing and dicing data
SSRS Reports: Tabular reports based on data warehouse
Power BI Reports: Interactive reports and dashboards
This architecture leverages the strengths of each Microsoft BI tool to create a robust data platform that supports data extraction, transformation, modeling, analysis, and reporting.
